% Select the Reaction ID names to be changed to new flux values

    % Cell numbers you want to change the flux values of
    [~,idx_chng] = ismember(rxn_chng,m.rates.flx.id);
    % It's very important to fix the flux to be changed before changing it
    % otherwise it will be rebalanced after flux feasibility adjustment
    m.rates.flx.fix(idx_chng) = 1;
    % Now change the fluxes of interest to a new value
